Frontend application for Tessil - a secure, end-to-end encrypted file sharing service.

## Status

Active development. `main` is the working trunk and is not yet promoted for general production use.

## Features

- Drag and drop file upload
- Client-side AES-GCM encryption (files encrypted before upload)
- Encrypted filenames
- Optional password protection
- Configurable expiration (1, 6, 12, 24, or 72 hours)
- Progress tracking for encryption and upload
- Dark mode UI

## Tech Stack

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - Web framework
- [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/) - UI framework with runes
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styling
- [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) - Encryption

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.0 or higher

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

## Security Model

Tessil uses end-to-end encryption:

1. **File encryption**: Files are encrypted in the browser using AES-GCM with a randomly generated 256-bit key
2. **Filename encryption**: Filenames are also encrypted with the same key
3. **Key storage**: The encryption key is stored in the URL fragment (after `#`) and never sent to the server
4. **Optional password**: Adds server-side access control (separate from encryption)

The server never has access to:

- Unencrypted files
- Original filenames
- Encryption keys
