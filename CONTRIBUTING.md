# Contributing to Tessil Web

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tessil Web! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tessil-web.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Install dependencies: `bun install`

## Development

```bash
# Start development server
bun run dev

# Type check
bun run check

# Build for production
bun run build

# Preview production build
bun run preview
```

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow Svelte 5 patterns (use runes: `$state`, `$derived`, `$props`)
- Use semantic CSS classes from the design system
- Keep components focused and reusable

## Commit Messages

Conventional commits are enforced via a `commit-msg` git hook (lefthook +
commitlint), installed automatically when you run `bun install`. A commit with
a non-conformant message will be rejected before it lands in history.
