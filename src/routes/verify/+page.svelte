            You should not have to trust us, and these checks do not ask you to.
            None of them rely on something we assert. Each one relies on
            something your own browser reports, and you can run them against the
            live site right now.
          </p>
          <p class={bodyClass}>
            You will need a transfer you sent to yourself, and your browser's
            developer tools: <code>F12</code> on Windows and Linux,
            <code>Cmd + Option + I</code> on a Mac.
          </p>

        <section class={sectionClass}>
          <h2 class={headingClass}>1. The key never reaches our servers</h2>
          <p class={bodyClass}>
            Send yourself a file from the homepage. The link you get back looks
            like this:
          </p>
          <pre class={preClass}><code
              >https://tessil.app/d/7f3a9c2b#kA9tR2xQ...</code
            ></pre>
          <p class={bodyClass}>
            Everything after the <code>#</code> is the decryption key. Your browser
            generated it, and it is the only thing that turns our stored ciphertext
            back into your file.
          </p>
          <ol class={stepsClass}>
            <li>Copy the part of the link after the <code>#</code>.</li>
            <li>Open the link, then open developer tools and select Network.</li>
            <li>Reload the page and let it finish loading.</li>
            <li>Search the recorded requests for the key you copied.</li>

            <p class="text-muted-foreground">
              Browsers do not send the fragment (the part after <code>#</code>)
              to servers. That is the HTTP standard, enforced by the browser you
              are already running, not a policy we promise to honour. There is
              no request we could quietly inspect to learn that key, because it
              is never transmitted.

            <li>With the Network tab still open, download the file.</li>
            <li>
              Find the request to an address ending in
              <code>r2.cloudflarestorage.com</code>. That is the stored object,
              byte for byte as it sits on our storage.

            <p class="text-muted-foreground">
              That is our container format marker. Not your file, not your
              filename, not a thumbnail. The readable file only comes into
              existence after your browser applies the key from step 1. If
              somebody walked off with our entire storage bucket, this is what
              they would have.

              Still in the Network tab, look at every domain the page contacted.

              No analytics, no tag manager, no fonts pulled from someone else's
              CDN, no session recorder. On a page whose URL contains a
              decryption key, a third-party script is not a privacy nuisance, it
              is a key leak.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p class={bodyClass}>
            This is enforced rather than promised. Two Content-Security-Policy
            layers apply to every page and both have to pass. The first is a
            response header you can read yourself:
          </p>
          <pre class={preClass}><code
              >curl -sI https://tessil.app | grep -i content-security-policy</code
            ></pre>
          <p class={bodyClass}>
            <code>connect-src</code> there limits network requests to our own
            origin and the storage host, so a script could not phone home even
            if one were added by mistake. The second layer is in the page
            itself: view source and you will find a
            <code>content-security-policy</code> meta tag whose
            <code>script-src</code> pins the exact SHA-256 hash of the only inline
            script we ship. Any other inline script, injected by anyone, fails the
            hash and never executes.
          </p>

        <section class={sectionClass}>
          <h2 class={headingClass}>4. Read the code</h2>
          <p class={bodyClass}>
            Optional, and the slowest of the four, but it is the only check that
            shows you intent rather than behaviour. Tessil is AGPL-3.0 and the

            The checks above are worth little without this part. We do not need
            to be trusted about your file contents, because the maths handles
            that. We do need to be trusted about the following list, so here it
            is in full:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-muted-foreground space-y-1 ml-4">

            <li>How many times a transfer has been downloaded</li>
            <li>When a transfer expires, and when it was deleted</li>
            <li>Your email address, if you chose to create an account</li>
            <li>
              For sign-in events, the country and network operator derived from
              your IP address at that moment. We do not store IP addresses.

            File contents, filenames, and transfer titles are not on that list,
            and cannot be, because they arrive encrypted. The full detail lives
